# gt

`gt` is a lightweight shell function that allows you to quickly change directories based on key-to-path mappings defined in a configuration file. With a simple command, you can jump to frequently used directories, making navigation faster and more efficient.

## Features

- **Quick Navigation:** Jump to a directory using a simple key.
- **Configurable:** Mappings are stored in a dedicated file (`~/.gt_locations`).
- **Help Functionality:** Run `gt --help` to list all available mappings.
- **Error Handling:** Displays helpful messages if a key isnâ€™t found or if the configuration file is missing.

## Installation

1. **Download the Function**

   Save the `gt` function to a file (for example, `gt.sh`).

2. **Source the Function in Your Shell**

   - **Bash:** Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`:
     ```bash
     source /path/to/gt.sh
     ```
   - **Zsh:** Add the following line to your `~/.zshrc`:
     ```bash
     source /path/to/gt.sh
     ```

3. **Apply Changes**

   Restart your terminal or source your configuration file manually:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   # or
   source ~/.zshrc
